          How do you determine pricing?
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-body">
          <p>
            We price by <strong>how much space your items take in our truck</strong>, 
            not by the hour. We'll give you an upfront quote before we start—the 
            price we quote is the price you pay. No hidden fees!

            Yes! We offer same-day junk removal for most jobs. Give us a call

            yard debris, construction waste, and more. The only things we can't take 
            are hazardous materials, chemicals, and certain regulated items.
