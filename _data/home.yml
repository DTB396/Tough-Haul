  title: "Tile Installation & Waterproofing Built to Standards"
  summary: >
    Tile is durable only when the system is built correctly: substrate prep,
    verified flatness, correct mortars and grouts, movement accommodation,
    and bonded waterproofing where required. Work follows TCNA 2024 Handbook
    methods, ANSI A108 installation standards, and ANSI A118 material specifications.

    Real talk: I measure substrates with precision tools—not my eyes.
    Waterproofing gets detailed per the system spec and tested where required
    before tile goes down. You receive a photo documentation package for your records.

  title: "Transparent Workflow, Written Agreements, Full Documentation"
  summary: >
    Every project follows a clear sequence: assessment, written estimate,
    execution to scope, verification, and closeout documentation.
    Change orders are approved in writing before work continues.
  fun_fact: >
    Substrate flatness is verified with long straightedges and precision levels
    appropriate to the space and tile format. Movement joints are designed and installed
    per TCNA EJ171 to prevent cracking and tenting.
