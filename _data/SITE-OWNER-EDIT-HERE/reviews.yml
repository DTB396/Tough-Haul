      These guys are amazing! They showed up on time, gave me an upfront price,
      and hauled away my old couch and two mattresses in no time. Super professional
      and way easier than trying to do it myself. Will definitely use again!

      Used Tough Haul for a garage cleanout before moving. They took everything—
      old furniture, boxes of junk, broken appliances. The crew was friendly,
      fast, and the price was very fair. Highly recommend!

      Called in the morning, they were here by afternoon. Hauled away a broken
      refrigerator and old washer/dryer set. The guys were careful not to damage
      my floors and cleaned up after themselves. Great service!

      After a big storm, we had tons of branches and yard debris. Tough Haul
      came out and cleared everything in a couple hours. They even swept up
      the small stuff. So grateful for the quick response!

      Needed help clearing out my parents' house for an estate sale. The team
      was respectful, efficient, and handled everything with care. They donated
      usable items and recycled what they could. Professional service.

      I've used Tough Haul three times now for various cleanout projects.
      Always reliable, always fair pricing, and the crews are always friendly.
      They're my go-to for junk removal!
