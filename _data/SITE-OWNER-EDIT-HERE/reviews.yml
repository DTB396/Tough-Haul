      Gabriel really helped me out by getting rid of multiple bags of garbage and boxes 
      from my mom's house for a very reasonable price. He and his team were prompt, 
      professional, and very friendly. I will definitely be using his services in the 
      future and I highly recommend him for your disposal needs.

      I can't express enough gratitude and praise for Gabriel and Tough Haul Trash and 
      Junk LLC. He helped us clear our 4 years of accumulated stuff in our storage unit. 
      He was kind, efficient, fast, and most importantly, the best price in the area (by far). 
      For any future cleanups, I will not think twice. It will be Gabriel!

      Very happy with this service! I called and was able to get rid of the stuff I've 
      been putting off taking to the dump. They came and took care of everything. 
      Will be hiring them again.

      I called Tough Haul for a rather interesting request and wow did they deliver! 
      My fridge was heaping in residue from a long summer of entertaining and I was in 
      the market for someone to clean the interior head to toe. Tough Haul left it 
      sparkling and got to the job fast so I could have the fridge ready for a grocery 
      delivery the same day. Thanks for your hard work and attentiveness.
