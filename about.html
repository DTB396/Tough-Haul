    <p>
      Tillerstead LLC’s mission is to give South Jersey homeowners peace of mind by building tile and bathroom systems the right way—using proven industry standards, careful preparation, and clear, honest documentation. We follow the latest TCNA and New Jersey HIC requirements so every project is safe, durable, and fully code-compliant. Our goal: no shortcuts, no surprises, just lasting quality you can trust.

    <h2 id="details-heading">Why Details Matter</h2>
    <p>
      Tile problems usually don’t start at the surface. They start underneath: poor substrate prep, inadequate flatness, skipped movement accommodation, or a wet area that was never built as a true waterproofing assembly. That’s why our work begins with verification—then we build the system to the requirements of the selected method and materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don’t treat mortars and membranes as interchangeable. Material selection follows published specifications (including applicable ANSI classifications and manufacturer data sheets), and movement accommodation is planned and installed where required (including TCNA EJ171 guidance for movement joints).
    </p>
    <p>
      In showers and wet areas, waterproofing is constructed as a complete assembly—including transitions, penetrations, and drain integration—then verified before tile. Where testing is required or method-appropriate, we perform it and document it.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      The goal is simple: fewer surprises, fewer callbacks, and a bathroom you don’t have to think about.

    <h2 id="process-heading">How We Work</h2>
    <p>
      Most homeowners don’t want to manage trades—they want a clear plan and a clean result. Here’s what you can expect:
    </p>
    <ul class="ts-list">
      <li><strong>Written scope & contract:</strong> scope, materials, schedule approach, payment terms, and warranty—before work begins.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification before finishes:</strong> substrate readiness, wet-area system steps, and pre-tile checks are confirmed before covering work.</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation you can keep:</strong> key-phase photos compiled for owner records and future maintenance.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear communication:</strong> timely updates, and direct answers—especially when decisions affect cost or timeline.</li>
      <li><strong>Change orders in writing:</strong> scope or price changes are approved before we proceed—no surprise invoices.</li>
    </ul>
