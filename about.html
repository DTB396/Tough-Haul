        <p class="about-intro-card__lead">
          <strong>Tough Haul started with a simple idea:</strong> junk removal should be easy, 
          affordable, and hassle-free. No hidden fees, no bait-and-switch tactics, no 
          complicated scheduling—just honest service from a team that actually shows up.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've built our business on doing the job right the first time. That means arriving 
          on time, giving you an upfront estimate before we start, and leaving your space cleaner 
          than we found it. It's not complicated—it's just how business should be done.

              happy with the estimate, there's no obligation—no pressure, no awkward sales pitch.
