      <h2>How a Plumber Went from 2 Calls/Week to 15</h2>
      <p>
        A local plumbing company came to us with a basic template site that wasn't generating 
        any leads. We rebuilt their site with emergency service focus, added a simple quote 
        tool, and optimized for local search.
      </p>
      <ul class="case-study-results">
        <li><strong>7x increase</strong> in weekly calls</li>
        <li><strong>#1 ranking</strong> for "[city] emergency plumber"</li>
        <li><strong>30% conversion</strong> rate on quote tool</li>
