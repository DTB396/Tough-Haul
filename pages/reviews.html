        These testimonials are sourced from third-party platforms (such as Thumbtack) where reviewers submit feedback
        under that platform’s verification system.

        <ul class="ts-list">
          <li><strong>Client words are not edited:</strong> We do not rewrite, “clean up,” or change meaning. Formatting
            only (paragraphs/line breaks).</li>
          <li><strong>Source links included:</strong> Where available, we link to the originating platform.</li>
          <li><strong>No incentives:</strong> We don’t offer discounts or compensation for reviews.</li>
          <li><strong>Work is documented:</strong> For projects involving tile/wet areas, we document key phases so
            clients know what was built before it’s covered.</li>
        </ul>

          Note: Reviews describe customer experience. Project requirements vary by site conditions, materials, and
          scope.
