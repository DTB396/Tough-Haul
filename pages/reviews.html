<p>It was a pleasure working with Devon to repair our closet ceiling. We chose to repair it rather than replace, and he
  walked us through what that would look like while offering the most cost-effective option. He was professional
  throughout. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I recently hired Devon for a bathroom remodel, and my wife and I couldn’t be happier with the results. He was
  professional, punctual, and detail-oriented from start to finish. He listened to what we wanted, offered helpful
  suggestions, and executed everything with precision.</p>
<p>Devon kept the work area tidy throughout the project and completed the job on time without cutting corners. It’s rare
  to find someone who truly takes pride in their work the way he does. I’d highly recommend him.</p>

<p>I hired Devon Tyler for tile work in my home and was impressed by his patience, precision, and professionalism. He
  took his time to get every cut right and made sure the job was solid and clean. I’d absolutely recommend him to anyone
  looking for quality tile work done with care.</p>
