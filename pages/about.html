      Tillerstead LLC delivers standards-based tile installations with written scope, verified execution, and photo
      documentation.
      Licensed New Jersey HIC #13VH10808800, serving Atlantic, Ocean & Cape May Counties. Projects prioritize substrate
      verification,
      wet-area waterproofing per the selected system, and records that support future maintenance and resale.

      <h2 id="details-heading">Why Details Matter: Standards, Not Guesswork</h2>
      <p>
        Tile failures usually start underneath the tile: prep, flatness, moisture management, and movement
        accommodation.
        We verify substrate conditions with appropriate straightedges/levels for the space and tile format, then build
        the assembly
        to the requirements of the selected method and materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mortars and membranes aren’t “one-size-fits-all.” Material selection follows published specifications (ANSI A118
        classifications,
        manufacturer data sheets, and the requirements of the installation method). Movement accommodation is planned
        and installed per
        <strong>TCNA EJ171</strong> where required.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach takes more effort than “some guy,” but it reduces the risk of cracked tile, leaks, and avoidable
        remediation.
        When wet areas are involved, waterproofing is installed per the system requirements and flood tested where
        required by the
        TCNA method or manufacturer—then documented.

      <p>
        If you’re tired of vague promises and disappearing contractors, here’s what you can expect with Tillerstead:
      </p>
      <ul class="ts-list">
        <li><strong>Written scope & contract:</strong> Scope, materials, timeline, payment terms, and change-order
          process—before work begins.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation you can keep:</strong> Prep, key details, and progress photos compiled for your
          records.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive communication:</strong> Calls and texts returned same day when possible—no “maybe next
          week.”</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate timelines:</strong> If we commit to dates, we keep them (or we communicate early and in
          writing).</li>
        <li><strong>Change orders in writing:</strong> Scope or price changes are approved before we proceed—no surprise
          invoices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        It shouldn’t be rare. But it is.
