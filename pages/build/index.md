# Tillerstead Build Process

Welcome to the official build documentation for Tillerstead.com. This page outlines our site generation, deployment, and quality control workflows. All steps comply with TCNA 2024 and New Jersey HIC standards.

# The Build Phase

<<<<<<< HEAD
The **Build Phase** is a complete, step-by-step guide to how a bathroom or shower should be planned, built, and verified under **TCNA standards** and **New Jersey construction requirements**.

This is not a DIY manual.  
It’s an **education and alignment resource** designed to help homeowners, designers, and contractors understand what actually determines long-term performance.

---

## Why These Guides Exist

Most bathroom failures don’t start with tile.

They start earlier—at framing, waterproofing, slope, drainage, or skipped verification steps that are later hidden by finished surfaces.
=======
# Build Phase: How We Build (and How You Can Verify It)

The **Build Phase** is Tillerstead’s standards-forward guide to bathroom and shower projects in New Jersey.
It explains the *sequence*, the *verification points*, and the *common failure modes*—so expectations are clear before anything is sealed behind tile.

This is **not a DIY manual**. It’s an education and alignment resource for homeowners who want a durable, compliant result.  
(References include TCNA Handbook methods, ANSI tile standards, ASTM testing guidance, and NJ UCC context.)

---

## What We Build

- Code-aware bathroom and shower remodels planned around **permits, inspections, and verifiable system steps**
- Wet-area assemblies built as **systems** (structure → slope/drain → waterproofing → tile)
- Clear documentation habits (photos at key phases; verification before concealment)

## What We Don’t Do (by policy)

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Set clear expectations before construction begins
- Reduce surprises during the build
- Help homeowners recognize quality workmanship
- Explain *why* each phase exists—not just *what* it is

## The Construction Sequence (8 Phases)

Each phase builds on the one before it.  
For the full picture, read in order. If you’re researching a specific issue, you can jump directly to the relevant phase.

---

### Phase 1 — Codes, Permits & Inspections
Understanding New Jersey’s construction code, permit requirements, and inspection sequence.

**Key focus:** legality, compliance, and accountability  
**[Read Phase 1 →](/build/nj-codes-permits/)**

---

### Phase 2 — Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains
How water is directed safely to the drain *before* tile is installed.

**Key focus:** slope, drainage, pan construction  
**[Read Phase 2 →](/build/shower-pans-slopes-drains/)**

---

### Phase 3 — Waterproofing Systems
Surface-applied vs. traditional systems, continuity, and compatibility.

**Key focus:** ANSI A118.10 compliant waterproofing  
**[Read Phase 3 →](/build/waterproofing-systems/)**

---

### Phase 4 — Curbs & Curbless Showers
Containing water at the shower entry, including curbless designs permitted in NJ.

**Key focus:** thresholds, transitions, accessibility  
**[Read Phase 4 →](/build/curbs-curbless/)**

---

### Phase 5 — Framing for Benches, Seats & Niches
Structural planning that must happen *before* waterproofing.

**Key focus:** load, slope, and integration  
**[Read Phase 5 →](/build/framing-benches-niches/)**

---

### Phase 6 — Tile Installation Standards
How tile is bonded to the system and why preparation matters more than tile choice.

**Key focus:** ANSI A108/A118 standards  
**[Read Phase 6 →](/build/tile-installation-standards/)**

---

### Phase 7 — Flood Testing & Verification
The final opportunity to verify waterproofing before finishes conceal the work.

**Key focus:** ASTM D5957 flood testing  
**[Read Phase 7 →](/build/flood-testing/)**

---

### Phase 8 — Common Failures & Red Flags
Where failures originate, warning signs to watch for, and how proper sequencing prevents them.

**Key focus:** prevention, not repair  
**[Read Phase 8 →](/build/common-build-failures/)**

---

## How to Use These Guides

**Homeowners:**  
Read in order to understand what quality construction actually involves.

**Designers & Architects:**  
Use these phases to coordinate details and sequencing.

**Contractors:**  
Share these guides to align expectations and document methodology.

## The Build Phase Difference

| Shortcut Mentality | Build Phase Method |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Focus on finishes | Focus on systems |
| Trust without verification | Verify at each phase |
| Problems hidden by tile | Problems addressed early |
| No documentation | Photo & inspection documentation |

> **The best projects are the ones where nothing has to be explained after the fact.**

## Ready to Begin?

Start with **Phase 1: Codes, Permits & Inspections** to understand the legal and technical foundation of a compliant build.

=======
- “Tile-over-problems” work that hides substrate, slope, or waterproofing issues
- Mixed-system waterproofing assemblies without manufacturer compatibility or engineering rationale
- Rushed sequencing that skips verification steps (especially before finishes conceal the work)

---

## The 8 Phases (Read in Order)

Each phase builds on the previous one. Start at Phase 1 for the complete picture.

1. **Codes, Permits & Inspections** — scope, AHJ expectations, inspection flow  
2. **Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains** — water direction before tile  
3. **Waterproofing Systems** — continuity + compatibility  
4. **Curbs vs. Curbless** — threshold containment details  
5. **Benches, Seats & Niches** — framing that won’t move  
6. **Tile Installation Standards** — substrate, mortar, coverage, movement accommodation  
7. **Flood Testing & Verification** — prove it before it’s hidden  
8. **Common Failures & Red Flags** — how shortcuts turn into expensive tear-outs

## Plain-English Promise

A good project is one where **nothing needs to be explained after the fact**.
That usually means the hard work happened *before* finishes went in.

If you want to discuss a project in South Jersey, we’ll talk scope, permitting, timeline, and system choices before we talk tile aesthetics.
