# The Build Phase

The **Build Phase** is a complete, step-by-step guide to how a bathroom or shower should be planned, built, and verified under **TCNA standards** and **New Jersey construction requirements**.

This is not a DIY manual.  
It’s an **education and alignment resource** designed to help homeowners, designers, and contractors understand what actually determines long-term performance.

---

## Why These Guides Exist

Most bathroom failures don’t start with tile.

They start earlier—at framing, waterproofing, slope, drainage, or skipped verification steps that are later hidden by finished surfaces.

These guides exist to:

- Set clear expectations before construction begins
- Reduce surprises during the build
- Help homeowners recognize quality workmanship
- Explain *why* each phase exists—not just *what* it is

## The Construction Sequence (8 Phases)

Each phase builds on the one before it.  
For the full picture, read in order. If you’re researching a specific issue, you can jump directly to the relevant phase.

---

### Phase 1 — Codes, Permits & Inspections
Understanding New Jersey’s construction code, permit requirements, and inspection sequence.

**Key focus:** legality, compliance, and accountability  
**[Read Phase 1 →](/build/nj-codes-permits/)**

---

### Phase 2 — Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains
How water is directed safely to the drain *before* tile is installed.

**Key focus:** slope, drainage, pan construction  
**[Read Phase 2 →](/build/shower-pans-slopes-drains/)**

---

### Phase 3 — Waterproofing Systems
Surface-applied vs. traditional systems, continuity, and compatibility.

**Key focus:** ANSI A118.10 compliant waterproofing  
**[Read Phase 3 →](/build/waterproofing-systems/)**

---

### Phase 4 — Curbs & Curbless Showers
Containing water at the shower entry, including curbless designs permitted in NJ.

**Key focus:** thresholds, transitions, accessibility  
**[Read Phase 4 →](/build/curbs-curbless/)**

---

### Phase 5 — Framing for Benches, Seats & Niches
Structural planning that must happen *before* waterproofing.

**Key focus:** load, slope, and integration  
**[Read Phase 5 →](/build/framing-benches-niches/)**

---

### Phase 6 — Tile Installation Standards
How tile is bonded to the system and why preparation matters more than tile choice.

**Key focus:** ANSI A108/A118 standards  
**[Read Phase 6 →](/build/tile-installation-standards/)**

---

### Phase 7 — Flood Testing & Verification
The final opportunity to verify waterproofing before finishes conceal the work.

**Key focus:** ASTM D5957 flood testing  
**[Read Phase 7 →](/build/flood-testing/)**

---

### Phase 8 — Common Failures & Red Flags
Where failures originate, warning signs to watch for, and how proper sequencing prevents them.

**Key focus:** prevention, not repair  
**[Read Phase 8 →](/build/common-build-failures/)**

---

## How to Use These Guides

**Homeowners:**  
Read in order to understand what quality construction actually involves.

**Designers & Architects:**  
Use these phases to coordinate details and sequencing.

**Contractors:**  
Share these guides to align expectations and document methodology.

## The Build Phase Difference

| Shortcut Mentality | Build Phase Method |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Focus on finishes | Focus on systems |
| Trust without verification | Verify at each phase |
| Problems hidden by tile | Problems addressed early |
| No documentation | Photo & inspection documentation |

> **The best projects are the ones where nothing has to be explained after the fact.**
