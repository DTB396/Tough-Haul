hero_title: "Transparent Workflow. Written Scope. Documented Work."
hero_summary: >-
Every Tillerstead project follows a clear sequence: assess → scope → prep → build → verify → closeout.
For tile work, we follow TCNA methods and applicable ANSI A108/A118 standards, plus manufacturer requirements.
For home improvement work, everything is put in writing—scope, price, schedule, and change orders—so there are no
surprises.

      Good tile work is mostly what you don’t see: prep, waterproofing continuity, and movement accommodation.
      We document the process so you can verify what was built—before it’s covered up.
